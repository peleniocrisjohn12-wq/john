                [Verse 1: ZAYN]
                I can show you the world: shining, shimmering, splendid
                Tell me, princess, now when did you last let your heart decide?
                I can open your eyes, take you wonder by wonder
                Over, sideways, and under on a magic carpet ride</pre>
            <pre>
                [Chorus: ZAYN & Zhavia]
                A whole new world, a new fantastic point of view
                No one to tell us "no," or where to go
                Or say we're only dreaming
                A whole new world, a dazzling place I never knew
                But when I’m way up here, it's crystal clear
                That now I'm in a whole new world with you
                Now I’m in a whole new world with you.</pre>
            <pre>
                [Verse 2: Zhavia]
                Unbelievable sights, indescribable feeling
                Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
                Through an endless diamond sky</pre>
            <pre>
                [Chorus: Zhavia, ZAYN, Both]
                A whole new world (Don't you dare close your eyes)
                A hundred thousand things to see (Hold your breath; it gets better)
                I'm like a shooting star, I've come so far
                I can't go back to where I used to be
                A whole new world, with new horizons to pursue
                I'll chase them anywhere, there's time to spare
                Let me share this whole new world with you.</pre>

                <h2>Exercise Reflection</h2>
                <p>While working on this HTML code, I enjoyed combining different elements like images, audio, video, and song lyrics. It felt exciting to see how HTML can bring all types of media together in one webpage.
                   Adding the music and video made the page more interactive, and I realized how powerful HTML is for presenting multimedia content. I also liked organizing information using lists and headings. Although the code is not perfect, I can see my improvement in understanding how tags work.
                   This activity helped me appreciate how creativity and technical skills come together in web coding.
