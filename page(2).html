        <p>
            Tomato (Lycopersicum esculentum) is one of the world most famous horticultural crop due to its many uses.
            In cultivation, the crop originated in the new world and reached fairly in advanced stage of domestication which was transported to Europe and Asia (Rick, 1978).
                The crop was first found throughout tropical and subtropical America and in the tropics of Asia and Africa. In Asia, it is possible that cultivated tomato was
            introduced by Spaniards from Europe in the Philippines either shorthly after discovery of the Philippines by Ferdinand Magellan in 1521, from Mexico at the initation
            of the Galeon trade between Manila in 1750 or trade between Philippines and neighboring countries (Villareal, 1980).
         <p>
                Tomato is eaten as fresh vegetables or a fruit and later processed into secondary products that is served already in the cans or any container for for the best food preparations.
            The fruit has high nutrional value that contributes to human health. It has been ranked first among vegetables crops by various group of scientist, policy makers, and farmers
            because of its great potentials to generate and stimulate rural and urban employment, expand exports, increase income of the farmers (Villareal, 1993).
                Most of the farmers sell their product at the nearest possible market to minimize losses even if sold at low price due to lack of cold storage facilities and this happen mostly
            in the rural areas. Tomato fruits can only be kept for almost two(2) weeks under ordinary room condition without refrigeration. Most people happen to buy only few kilos of fruits because it is 
            highly perishable crop.
         <p>
                Several village storage methods reported had been used to prevent or prolong the post-harvest life of the perishable fruit like tomato. It can be stored in lime ash and
            dust saw. Since tomato fruit is perishable crop, producers are longing fot the best way to prolong the post-harvest life of tomato fruits. The extension life of the fruit basically rely
            on the handling and the environmental temperature. Pantastico, (1975) reported that he mature green tomato fruits stored at 9c to 10c temperature and 85% to 90% relative humidity will last 
            seven days longer than that stored at ambient condition of 27c to 32c temperature.
          <p>  
                The finding of the above students on the different village storage methods and the treatments on different temperatures have played vital role in promoting the qualities
            on the post-harvest life of perishable crops specifically on the tomato fruits. Since there is no report yet of the study using different packaging materials with varying thickeness on the post harvest 
            life of tomato fruits here in Calbayog City, this experiment was pursued with the end view of the effects of these different packaging materials with varying thickness on 
            the storage behavior of tomato fruits.
        </p>
        <h4>Objectives of the study:</h4>
        <p>
            This study was specifically conduct to:
            <p>1. Determine the effects of the different packaging materials with varying thickness on the post-harvest life of tomato fruits.
            <p>2.Identify which among the packaging materials would prolong the post-harvest life of fruits stored at ambient room condition.
        </p>
        <h4>Time and Place of the study:</h4>
        <p>
            This study was conducted in the CTEAS chemistry Laboratory room, TTMIST, Calbayog City from february 9, 2005 up to february 28, 2005
        </p>
        <h4>Scope and Limitation of the study:</h4>
        <p>
             This study focused only on the effects of the different packaging materials used with varying thickness on the post-harvest life of tomato fruits stored ambient room condition.

                <h2>Exercises Reflection</h2>
                <p>While working on my HTML code, I realized that I already have a basic understanding of how a webpage is made. 
                   I used headings like h1 to h4 to organize the sections, and this helped me arrange my content clearly. But as I checked my work,
                   I noticed I made several mistakes, such as repeating the (body)tag, forgetting closing tags, and placing some headings inside paragraphs. 
                   These errors made me understand that even small details in HTML can affect how the page appears. Still, I’m glad that I was able to separate each part of the document correctly. This experience reminded me that I still need to pay more attention to structure, 
                   but I am also improving and learning as I go.</p>
